# Shimmer3DOrientationExample

This example uses the Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer to calculate orientation. Prior to using this example, calibrating the Shimmer3 Device using 9DoF Calibration (http://www.shimmersensing.com/support/wireless-sensor-networks-download) is recommended. 
The following sensors should be calibrated
- Low Noise Accel
- Gyroscope at 500dps
- Magnetometer

Known issues:-
- Magnetometer is fixed to a low data rate, and should be increased to improve accuracy and responsiveness of the orientation algorithm
