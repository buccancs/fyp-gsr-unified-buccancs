## Setup Instructions

### 1. Android App Setup

1. **Build and Install Android App**:
   ```bash
   # In IntelliJ IDEA
   # 1. Open the project
   # 2. Select "Android App" run configuration
   # 3. Build and install on connected device
   ```

2. **Grant Permissions**:
   - Camera permission
   - Microphone permission
   - Storage permissions
   - Bluetooth permissions (for GSR sensor)
   - Location permissions (for Bluetooth scanning)

3. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure Android device is connected to WiFi
   - Note the device's IP address (Settings > WiFi > Network details)
   - Ensure the network allows device-to-device communication

### 2. PC Controller Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd pc-app
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure PC is on the same WiFi network as Android devices
   - Configure Windows Firewall to allow connections on port 8080
   - Note the PC's IP address

## Testing Procedures

### 1. Build Verification Testing

First, verify that the system builds correctly:

```bash
# Android build verification
cd android-app
./gradlew build

# PC application verification
cd pc-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import pylsl; print('LSL version:', pylsl.library_version())"
```

### 2. LSL Integration Testing

Test the Lab Streaming Layer integration:

```bash
# Start LSL stream viewer (if available)
# This will show all LSL streams on the network

# On Android device:
# 1. Launch the GSR Multimodal app
# 2. Check LSL status in the app - should show "LSL streams initialized"
# 3. Start recording - LSL streams should become active

# Expected LSL streams:
# - GSR_[device_id] (3 channels: conductance, resistance, quality)
# - Thermal_[device_id] (6 channels: width, height, min_temp, max_temp, avg_temp, frame_number)
# - CommandResponse_[device_id] (1 channel: serialized responses)
```

### 3. Handler Integration Testing

Test each handler individually:

#### Camera Handler Testing
```bash
# In Android app:
# 1. Verify camera preview is visible
# 2. Start recording - should create MP4 file
# 3. Test raw frame capture - should capture individual frames
# 4. Test visual sync markers - should see white flash effect
# 5. Stop recording - should save video file with proper naming
```

#### GSR Handler Testing
```bash
# With Shimmer GSR+ sensor:
# 1. Pair Shimmer device via Bluetooth
# 2. Check connection status in app
# 3. Start streaming - should see real-time GSR values
# 4. Verify CSV data logging with timestamps
# 5. Check LSL stream for GSR data

# Without hardware (simulation mode):
# 1. App should show simulated GSR values
# 2. Values should update at 128 Hz
# 3. CSV logging should work normally
```

#### Thermal Camera Handler Testing
```bash
# With Topdon TC001 camera:
# 1. Connect thermal camera via USB-C
# 2. Grant USB permissions when prompted
# 3. Check thermal preview display
# 4. Start recording - should capture thermal frames
# 5. Verify thermal data CSV logging

# Without hardware (simulation mode):
# 1. App should show simulated thermal data
# 2. Thermal preview should display test pattern
# 3. Frame rate should be approximately 25 FPS
```

#### Hand Analysis Testing
```bash
# Post-recording analysis:
# 1. Record a video with hand movements
# 2. Stop recording
# 3. Tap "Analyze Hands" button (if available in UI)
# 4. Monitor analysis progress
# 5. Check for JSON output file with hand landmarks
```

### 4. Network Communication Testing

Test PC-Android communication:

```bash
# Start PC controller
cd pc-app
python main.py

# Expected behavior:
# 1. PC should discover Android devices automatically
# 2. Device registration should complete
# 3. Heartbeat monitoring should be active
# 4. Commands should be processed correctly
```

### 5. End-to-End Integration Testing

Test the complete system workflow:

```bash
# Complete workflow test:
# 1. Start PC controller application
# 2. Launch Android app on device(s)
# 3. Verify LSL streams are active
# 4. Verify device registration and heartbeat
# 5. Start synchronized recording from PC
# 6. Verify all handlers are recording (camera, GSR, thermal)
# 7. Check real-time data streaming to PC
# 8. Stop recording from PC
# 9. Verify all files are saved with proper naming
# 10. Test post-recording hand analysis
```

### 6. Performance and Stress Testing

Test system performance under load:

```bash
# Performance testing:
# 1. Extended recording sessions (30+ minutes)
# 2. Multiple device coordination (2+ Android devices)
# 3. High-frequency data streaming
# 4. Memory usage monitoring
# 5. Network latency testing
# 6. Error recovery testing (disconnect/reconnect devices)
```

## Testing Results Validation

### Expected Outputs

#### File Structure
After a successful recording session, expect the following file structure:
```
session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
├── device_1/
│   ├── rgb_video_TIMESTAMP.mp4
│   ├── rgb_frames/
│   ├── gsr_data_TIMESTAMP.csv
│   ├── thermal_data_TIMESTAMP.csv
│   └── hand_analysis_TIMESTAMP.json
├── device_2/ (if multiple devices)
└── session_manifest.json
```

#### LSL Stream Validation
- GSR streams should show 3 channels with 128 Hz data
- Thermal streams should show 6 channels with ~25 Hz data
- Command response streams should show acknowledgments
- All streams should have synchronized timestamps

#### Performance Metrics
- Camera recording: 1080p at 30 FPS
- GSR sampling: 128 Hz continuous
- Thermal capture: 25 FPS
- Network latency: < 100ms for commands
- Memory usage: Stable over extended periods

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### LSL Integration Issues
```bash
# If LSL streams don't appear:
# 1. Verify LSL runtime is installed
# 2. Check network connectivity
# 3. Restart Android app
# 4. Check firewall settings for LSL ports (16571-16604)
```

#### Handler Connection Issues
```bash
# GSR Handler:
# 1. Verify Bluetooth is enabled
# 2. Check Shimmer device pairing
# 3. Verify permissions are granted

# Thermal Handler:
# 1. Check USB-C connection
# 2. Grant USB permissions when prompted
# 3. Verify Topdon device compatibility

# Camera Handler:
# 1. Check camera permissions
# 2. Verify no other apps are using camera
# 3. Restart app if camera fails to initialize
```

#### Network Communication Issues
```bash
# PC-Android Communication:
# 1. Verify devices are on same WiFi network
# 2. Check firewall settings (port 8080)
# 3. Restart both PC and Android applications
# 4. Check device IP addresses
```
