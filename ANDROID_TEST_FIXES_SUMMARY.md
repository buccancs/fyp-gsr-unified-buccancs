# Android Test and Import Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Build System Issues

- The project has correct dependency configuration in `build.gradle.kts` and `libs.versions.toml`
- However, dependencies are not being resolved, suggesting a Gradle sync issue
- Protobuf classes need to be generated from `android-app/app/src/main/proto/messages.proto`

### 2. Import Issues

- Test files correctly import protobuf classes from `gsrunified` package
- The package structure is correct: `com.gsrunified.android`
- Main issue is that protobuf classes haven't been generated

### 3. Test Implementation Issues

- Some tests try to mock methods that don't exist in the actual classes
- HandAnalysisHandlerTest.kt has incorrect method mocking

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed PerformanceMonitorTest.kt

- Added missing import: `import com.gsrunified.android.core.PerformanceMonitor`

### 2. Fixed HandAnalysisHandlerTest.kt

- Removed incorrect method mocking for non-existent methods
- Updated test to work with actual API

### 3. Created SimpleTest.kt

- Basic test without external dependencies for verification

## Required Actions

### 1. Generate Protobuf Classes

The project needs to run protobuf generation:

```bash
cd android-app
./gradlew generateProto
```

### 2. Gradle Sync

The project needs proper Gradle sync:

```bash
cd android-app
./gradlew clean build
```

### 3. Dependency Resolution

All test dependencies are properly configured in:

- `android-app/gradle/libs.versions.toml`
- `android-app/app/build.gradle.kts`

The issue is likely that the project hasn't been properly synced with Gradle.

## Test Files Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed Files

- `PerformanceMonitorTest.kt` - Added correct import
- `HandAnalysisHandlerTest.kt` - Fixed method mocking issues

### ‚úÖ Correct Files (No Changes Needed)

- `LslStreamManagerTest.kt` - Imports are correct
- All other test files have correct package declarations

### üìù Configuration Files

- `build.gradle.kts` - All dependencies properly configured
- `libs.versions.toml` - All versions properly defined
- `messages.proto` - Protobuf definitions are correct

## Conclusion

The Android test and import issues are primarily due to:

1. Missing protobuf class generation
2. Gradle sync issues
3. Some incorrect test implementations

The package structure and import statements are correct. The main fix needed is to properly build the project to
generate protobuf classes and resolve dependencies.
