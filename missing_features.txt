### Missing Feature: Broader Hardware Support

**Description:** The system is tightly coupled to specific hardware models (Topdon TC001, Shimmer3 GSR+).

**Evidence:**
- The `README.md` "Hardware Constraints" section explicitly states these limitations.
- The manager classes in the Android app directly reference these specific models instead of using generic interfaces.

**Impact:** The system is not extensible to other sensors or cameras without significant code modification.

---
### Missing Feature: Network Security

**Description:** There is no authentication or encryption for the communication between devices.

**Evidence:**
- `README.md` "Current Blockers": `Network Security: No authentication/encryption for device connections`.

**Impact:** In a shared network environment, communication is insecure and could be intercepted. Unintended devices could potentially connect to the controller.

---
### âœ… IMPLEMENTED: Data Export and Conversion Tools

**Description:** The system now includes comprehensive tools to export collected data into common analysis formats like MATLAB and HDF5.

**Current Status:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- The `shared/utils/DataExporter.java` utility provides comprehensive data export functionality.
- Supports multiple export formats: MATLAB (.mat scripts), HDF5 (.h5 scripts), and organized CSV bundles.
- Can process complete recording sessions including GSR data, video files, thermal frames, and audio files.
- Automatically parses session metadata and organizes data for analysis.
- Generates ready-to-run MATLAB and Python scripts for creating analysis-ready data files.

**Export Formats Available:**
1. **MATLAB_MAT**: Generates MATLAB scripts that create .mat files with all session data
2. **HDF5**: Generates Python scripts that create HDF5 files with hierarchical data organization
3. **CSV_BUNDLE**: Creates organized directories with CSV files and metadata for manual analysis

**Usage:**
```bash
java -cp shared com.buccancs.gsr.shared.utils.DataExporter <session_directory> <format> [output_directory]
```

**Impact:** Researchers now have automated tools to convert raw session data into analysis-ready formats, eliminating the need for manual parsing and significantly streamlining the research workflow.
